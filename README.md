# evg : Svg -> Elm

**evg** is a helper for transforming SVG into Elm ([`elm-lang/svg`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/svg/latest)).

At the moment it has many assumptions and it doesn't process XML in a very
strict way. As a consequence, you should expect odd results if your SVG has
namespaces (e.g. `xlink:href`).
